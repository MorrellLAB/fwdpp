<div class="textblock"><h2>0.3.2</h2>
<p>This release make some tweaks that improve performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>All occurrences of boost::pool_allocator have been replaced by boost::fast_pool_allocator in the declarations of population types in the sugar layer (see <a class="el" href="../../db/dd8/md_md_sugar.html">Tutorial 5: the "sugar" layer on top of fwdpp</a>). This can result in &gt;= 10% reductions in run times are recombination rates increase.</li>
<li>The mechanics of adding mutations and recombining gametes have been streamlined slightly.</li>
<li>A handful of cases where objects were copied instead of passed-by-reference were fixed.</li>
<li>Issue #17 fixed</li>
<li>Issue #14 fixed</li>
<li>Issue #16 fixed</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.3.1</h2>
<p>This release has many significant changes. With the exception of the removal of KTfwd::tags::gamete_dependent, which was released in 0.3.0, and the change in the implementation of KTfwd::infsites::operator(), the library remains source-compatible with existing simulations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multilocus, single-population version of <a class="el" href="../../da/d8b/namespaceKTfwd.html#a18df6351fa3148914bbb844c36bc3e05">KTfwd::sample_diploid</a> now allows for inbreeding coefficient of 0 by default.</li>
<li>Warnings from <a class="el" href="../../df/d07/structKTfwd_1_1infsites.html" title="Generic function object implementing the infinitely-many sites mutation model for &quot;standard&quot; populati...">KTfwd::infsites</a> suppressed w/compiler trick</li>
<li>Extraneous gsl_rng free removed from <a class="el" href="../../d9/de8/diploid__ind_8cc.html">diploid_ind.cc</a></li>
<li>Issue #12 in <a class="el" href="../../df/d10/common__ind_8hpp.html">examples/common_ind.hpp</a> fixed</li>
<li>Issue #13 appears to be fixed, too. This was tricky, as it was not reproducible on my systems, but is now fixed on the system of the person who reported it.</li>
<li>The library no longer requires that std::pair&lt; T,T &gt; are the types used for a diploid genotype (where the "T" are iterator types derived from gametes lists). Now, custom diploid genotypes may be used, as long as the follow certain constraints (see <a class="el" href="../../d2/dcd/md_md_customdip.html">Advanced topics: custom diploid genotypes</a> for documentation). Thanks to Jeremy Van Cleve for motivating this change, which should allow models involving space and social interactions, once some experimental features are worked out and become part of the main library (see below).</li>
<li>extensions/ directory renamed python_examples</li>
<li>Makefiles added for the boost.python examples. These are not generated by ./configure, as compiling these is simply different from compiling the examples/unit tests</li>
<li>Fitness policies for multilocus simulations now take iterators pointing to multilocus genotypes, in lieu of const-references to those genotypes. This is done for the sake of API consistency across the library, but it does break source-level compatibility with existing simulations (although fixes will be easy). Examples, unit tests, tutorials, etc., have been updated to account for this change.</li>
<li>Mutation distpach methods implemented in 0.3.0 via KTfwd::tags::gamete_dependent are now dispatched using std::true_type and std::false_type</li>
<li>Namespace <a class="el" href="../../d5/d8a/namespaceKTfwd_1_1experimental.html">KTfwd::experimental</a> has been added as a safe place for experimenting with future library features. The source files are in fwdpp/experimental. These headers do get installed with the library, but documentation will be minimal.</li>
<li>Example programs based on experimental features are in experimental_examples. These examples are "bleeding edge", and are not guaranteed to compile on all systems, especially those without complete working boost installations (including the compiled run-time libraries).</li>
<li>experimental_examples/sex_limited_ind.cc is an example of using experimental library features to simulate separate sexes, sex-specific fitness effects, etc.</li>
<li>Sugar typedefs in <a class="el" href="../../d5/dd9/singlepop_8hpp.html">fwdpp/sugar/singlepop.hpp</a>, <a class="el" href="../../df/dae/metapop_8hpp.html">fwdpp/sugar/metapop.hpp</a>, and in <a class="el" href="../../d6/d10/multiloc_8hpp.html">fwdpp/sugar/multiloc.hpp</a> are now compatible with custom diploid types. The template alias now defaults to a pair of iterators pointing to gametes, which you may over-ride with your own type.</li>
<li>The devtools setup script had some bugs fixed. (<a class="el" href="../../d9/d5d/md_md_devtools.html">Tutorial 4: Starting projects based on fwdpp</a>)</li>
<li><a class="el" href="../../da/d8b/namespaceKTfwd.html#a18df6351fa3148914bbb844c36bc3e05">KTfwd::sample_diploid</a> has been modified to make fewer calls to random number generators for the common use case of no selfing. This change results in N*generations fewer RNG calls, and can speed simulations by as much as ten percent. A side-effect is that results will differ from simulations compiled against earlier versions of the library. A preprocessor macro/symbol (FWDPP_COMPAT_0_3_0) has been introduced. Compilling programs with -DFWDPP_COMPAT_0_3_0 will result in the older/slower algorithm being used.</li>
<li>A new document describing preprocessor symbols and their effect on fwdpp has been added (<a class="el" href="../../d1/d6b/md_md_preproc.html">Preprocessor symbols</a>)</li>
<li>All occurrences of NULL in the library have been replaced with the C++11 <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstddef/nullptr_t/">nullptr</a>. The latter is safer in templates because the former can evaluate to 0 in some cases.</li>
<li>All gamete-based code has been removed from the library. If you need it for any reason, you're stuck with with 0.3.0 and earlier.</li>
<li>Mutation models may now have various function signatures. See <a class="el" href="../../d1/d7a/md_md_policies.html">Tutorial 1: Policies in fwdpp</a> and the example programs for details. The file fwdpp/tags/mutation_tags.hpp has been removed. This was introduced in 0.3.0, and defined KTfwd::tags::gamete_dependent, which has been replaced with a newer, much more flexible method of policy dispatching. See <a class="el" href="../../d3/d80/mutation__internal_8hpp.html">fwdpp/internal/mutation_internal.hpp</a> for the details of how this was done.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="../../dc/d54/type__traits_8hpp.html">fwdpp/type_traits.hpp</a> was added to the library, proving namespace <a class="el" href="../../d0/d30/namespaceKTfwd_1_1traits.html" title="Nested namespace type traits. ">KTfwd::traits</a>.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="../../df/d07/structKTfwd_1_1infsites.html" title="Generic function object implementing the infinitely-many sites mutation model for &quot;standard&quot; populati...">KTfwd::infsites</a> no longer requires that a pointer to a mutation list be passed to the call operator</li>
<li><a class="el" href="../../de/d25/structKTfwd_1_1mutation__writer.html" title="Facilitates serialization of mutation types supported by the fwdpp sugar library. ...">KTfwd::mutation_writer</a> and <a class="el" href="../../d7/d1a/structKTfwd_1_1mutation__reader.html" title="Facilitates serialization of mutation types supported by the fwdpp sugar library. ...">KTfwd::mutation_reader</a> now support gzFiles.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="../../d1/d04/structKTfwd_1_1gzserialize.html">KTfwd::gzserialize</a> and <a class="el" href="../../d6/dde/structKTfwd_1_1deserialize.html" title="Deserialize population objects. ">KTfwd::deserialize</a> have been added to <a class="el" href="../../d8/d21/serialization_8hpp.html">fwdpp/sugar/serialization.hpp</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>0.3.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allow for mutation policies that depdend on the current state of a gamete via KTfwd::tags::gamete_dependent. Example <a class="el" href="../../d5/d77/HOC__ind_8cc.html">HOC_ind.cc</a> illustrates its use.</li>
<li>Added dispatch tag to <a class="el" href="../../d6/d90/structKTfwd_1_1gamete__base.html" title="Base class for gametes. ">KTfwd::gamete_base</a>, via <a class="el" href="../../dd/dbf/structKTfwd_1_1tags_1_1gamete__type__tag.html" title="Dispatch tags for gamete types. ">KTfwd::tags::gamete_type_tag</a>. Currently, this feature is not used in the library. Its addition affects nothing other than what happens during compilation, and it may be used in the future to add new features to the library, or it may be remvoed.</li>
<li>Namespace <a class="el" href="../../dd/d0a/namespaceKTfwd_1_1sugar.html" title="Nested namespace for sugar layer. ">KTfwd::sugar</a> and <a class="el" href="../../de/d6e/group__sugar.html">Syntactic sugar layer</a> functions added.</li>
<li>All <em>individual-based</em> examples have been rewritten using the sugar code</li>
<li>New tutorial added: <a class="el" href="../../db/dd8/md_md_sugar.html">Tutorial 5: the "sugar" layer on top of fwdpp</a></li>
<li>New tutorial added: <a class="el" href="../../d5/d00/md_md_datatypes.html">Tutorial 0: Data types in fwdpp</a></li>
<li>The policies tutorial (<a class="el" href="../../d1/d7a/md_md_policies.html">Tutorial 1: Policies in fwdpp</a>) has been rewritten</li>
<li>Unit tests for sugar layer added</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.9</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added new unit test (siteDepFitness) to check for the effect of issue #8. Fortunately, fitness calculations were correct even with the bug, as the rest of the function did the right thing.</li>
<li>Fixed issue #8, so that the code block in question will actually do what is intended.</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.8</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue #5, which was a bug in migrating gametes in multi-population, individual-based simulations.</li>
<li>Fixed issue #6, which was a bug in how parents were copied in multi-population, individual-based simulations.</li>
<li>Fixed issue #7, which was a bug in when gametes were updated post-sampling in multi-population, individual-based simulations.</li>
<li>Two new example programs added: migsel_split_ind and migsel_split_ind_list</li>
<li>fwdpp/IO.tcc streamlined using C++11 "auto" instead of nasty typedefs</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.7</h2>
<ul>
<li>Versions ms_sample and ms_sample_separate that took containers of gametes as arguments are now compatible with individual-based simulations.</li>
<li>The "devtools" stuff is greatly improved, and a new tutorial added on how to use it: <a class="el" href="../../d9/d5d/md_md_devtools.html">Tutorial 4: Starting projects based on fwdpp</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.6</h2>
<ul>
<li>const mutation lists now passed to binary output routines</li>
<li>The library internals now fully support C++11 move semantics</li>
<li>Default policies now support C++11 "perfect forwarding"</li>
<li>The function <a class="el" href="../../da/d8b/namespaceKTfwd.html#a8a46b107991548a40821e132496c1693" title="recombination for individual-based forward simulations ">KTfwd::recombine_gametes</a>, which is provided for recombination in individual-based simulations, has an overloaded version. This new version takes a fixed set of positions representing recombination breakpoints, allowing more modeling flexibility and making unit testing easier.</li>
<li>The mechanics of recombination in multilocus simulations moved to function multilocus_rec in namesapce <a class="el" href="../../de/dbd/namespaceKTfwd_1_1fwdpp__internal.html" title="Nested namespace for nuts and bolts of certain library functions. ">KTfwd::fwdpp_internal</a>.</li>
<li>A unit test for the function <a class="el" href="../../de/dbd/namespaceKTfwd_1_1fwdpp__internal.html#a3c36902b6ee80be11577986d681e5df8" title="The mechanics of recombination for multilocus simulations The mechanics of recombination for multiloc...">KTfwd::fwdpp_internal::multilocus_rec</a> was added.</li>
<li>Added tutorial for multilocus simulation implmentation</li>
<li>Minor cleanups to the build system</li>
<li>Reorganization of <a class="el" href="../../df/d9f/IO_8hpp.html">fwdpp/IO.hpp</a> and fwdpp/IO.tcc to reduce code duplication and provide output routines for multilocus simulations. There are no longer separate read functions for gzFiles. The necessary operations are handled automatically by overloads of template functions in namespace <a class="el" href="../../de/dbd/namespaceKTfwd_1_1fwdpp__internal.html" title="Nested namespace for nuts and bolts of certain library functions. ">KTfwd::fwdpp_internal</a>.</li>
<li>Reorganization of fwdpp/sampling_functions.tcc: overloads of ms_sample are now implemented via calls to ms_sample_separate. The results from the latter function are then merged using C++11 move semantics. This reduces code redundancy, reduces the possible locations of bugs, and should keep efficiency about the same.</li>
</ul>
<h2>0.2.5</h2>
<p>The following changes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>fwdpp/diploid_functions_ind_multilocus.tcc was added. This contains a more natural method of simulating mutiple partially-linked regions. The header <a class="el" href="../../df/d54/diploid__functions_8hpp.html" title="Wright-Fisher sampling in a finite population and recombination. ">fwdpp/diploid_functions.hpp</a> contains the relevant prototypes. These routines are still in "beta" stage, and full support for simulations of partially-linked regions will be put off until a future version, likely 0.2.6 or later.</li>
<li>Header files have been reorganized. <a class="el" href="../../df/df8/diploid_8hh.html" title="Main header for programming using this library. ">fwdpp/diploid.hh</a> is still the header to use. The reorg has been for the developer's sanity.</li>
<li>C++11 support is now required. A side-effect is that users may use what is currently the dev branch of libsequence, which requires c++11 and no longer requires boost. However, simulations using fwdpp will still be a <em>lot</em> faster with boost installed!</li>
<li>Internally, functions from namespace boost have been replaced with the namespace std equivalents provided by the C++11 standard.</li>
<li>The internal library functions have been audited for performance. This audit resulted in changing where some book-keeping functions were called, replacing linear-time search algorithms with logarithmic-time searches, and removing an unnecessary call to std::sort following crossover events. The result of this audit was a big speedup of simulation run-times, but no change in simulation output (in other words, the same random number seed gives the same result for the same parameters for the same program in 0.2.4 and 0.2.5).</li>
<li>autoconf stuff rewritten (configure.ac, Makefile.am, etc.)</li>
<li>Internally, the library has moved to a more "functional programming" style, emphasizing lambda expressions over function objects. This change means that the library no longer needs to define function objects that are only used by the library "internals". Such function objects have been removed, replaced with lambda expressions, and will no longer clutter the library documentation.</li>
<li>The code for recombination has been streamlined quite a bit. Same algorithm (although noting the changes in point 5 above), but way fewer lines of code.</li>
<li>The devtools directory has been added. It contains a script to setup packages using fwdpp.</li>
<li>Examples are now built via "make check" and not by default</li>
<li>Refactoring so that gamete- and individual- based methods share common code.</li>
<li>A new namespace (<a class="el" href="../../de/dbd/namespaceKTfwd_1_1fwdpp__internal.html" title="Nested namespace for nuts and bolts of certain library functions. ">KTfwd::fwdpp_internal</a>) now resides in fwdpp/internal. This sub-namespace contains some of the more important inner-workings of the library that are used in several places. Part of the goal of this sub-namespace is to separate the deterministic stuff from the stochastic stuff, in order for the latter to be unit-testable.</li>
<li>Boost's unit testing library is now used for unit testing. To goal is to make sure that the stuff in fwdpp/internal all works. The tests are compiled via "make check".</li>
<li>Use config.h to manage preprocessor stuff</li>
</ol>
<h2>0.2.4</h2>
<p>The following changes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a class="el" href="../../df/d9f/IO_8hpp.html">fwdpp/IO.hpp</a> and fwdpp/IO.tcc were updated to include the ability to read/write binary-format data to/from gzip files. The gzip compression uses <a href="http://zlib.net">zlib</a>. Note that the combination of POSIX file locking + gzip output requires more work than "plain" binary output + file locking. Please see the new examples. Differences in how gztell vs. ftell mean that the index files generated are different. See my <a href="https://github.com/molpopgen/BigDataFormats">tutorial</a> on on "big data" file formats for more detail.</li>
<li>examples/pfix.cc was added. This estimates the fixation probability of a mutation subject to genic selection in a constant-sized population of N diploids.</li>
<li>examples/diploid_gzbinaryIO.cc and <a class="el" href="../../d0/d03/diploid__gzbinaryIO__ind_8cc.html">examples/diploid_gzbinaryIO_ind.cc</a> were added. They illustrate the new functions mentioned in point 1.</li>
<li>The folder "test" was added. This contains several Rmd (<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>) documents that you can process either in <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">R studio</a> or plain old <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>. In either case, you'll need <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html">knitr</a> installed. </li>
