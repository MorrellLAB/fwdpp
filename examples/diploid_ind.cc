/*! \include diploid_ind.cc
  Simulate a single, finite Wright-Fisher diploid population with mutation, recombination, and no selection.

  This is an individual-based implementation of the gamete-based program diploid.cc

  This program illustrates many features of fwdpp:
  1.  Custom mutation classes
  2.  Implementing a mutation model (infinitely-many sites)
  3.  Iterating a population through its life cycle
  4.  Outputting a sample in "ms" format

    Vectors for holding copies of pointers to mutations during recombination.
    The requirement to declare these was introduced in fwdpp 0.3.3.

    In previous versions of the library, vectors like this had to be allocated
    for every crossover event for every generation.  The result was an excessive 
    number of requests for memory allocation.

    Now, we create the vector once per simulation.  Further, we will reserve memory
    here, to minimize reallocs, etc., within fwdpp.

    Internally, fwdpp's job is to make sure that this vector is appropriately 
    and efficiently cleared, but only when needed.
