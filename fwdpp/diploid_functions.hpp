  /*!
    Overload for fixed xover positions.
    Typically, this is called by the version taking 
    a recombination policy as an argument.

    If you wish to call this version directly,
    only do so if length pos > 1, pos is sorted
    in ascending order, and the last value in 
    pos is std::numeric_limits<double>::max(),
    which is assumed to be a terminating value 
    larger than any possible value for a mutation's position.

    \param pos A vector (with interface of std::vector) containing recombination breakpoints.  See note below.
    \param gametes A container of the gametes segregating in the population
    \param g1 An iterator, derived from gametes, representing one parental gamete.
    \param g2 An iterator, derived from gametes, representing the other parental gamete.
    \return The number of breakpoints, which equals pos.size() - 1, as that is fixed in this case.
    \note The vector pos must be sorted (ascending order) and must contain the value std::numeric_limits<double>::max() as a terminating value.
