###Applications of fwdpp

Early version of the code that eventually became __fwdpp__ were used in the following publications:

* [Thornton et al.](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003258) on modeling "rare alleles of large effect" and genome-wide association studies
* [Baldwin-Brown et al.](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/1040.full) on modeling "evolve and resequence" experiments"
